*A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.*
The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System,
**In  DVCS working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project**, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.

### Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project,

*We can import and clone another a project to our repo*

**and we can use some cmd command to access  options in the github .**
