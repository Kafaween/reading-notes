## In decision theory and general systems theory, a mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notions held by one or more people or groups of people. A mindset can also be seen as arising out of a person's world view or philosophy of life.

## The term “growth mindset” comes from the groundbreaking work of Carol Dweck. She identified everyone holds ideas about their own potential. Some people believe that their intelligence is more or less fixed and in math – that you can do math or you can’t. About 40% of students have these damaging “fixed mindset” ideas. Another 40% have a “growth mindset” – they believe that they can learn anything and that their intelligence can grow. The other 20% waver between the two mindsets.

## People with a growth mindset believe their abilities can improve over time

*Having a growth mindset means more than just accepting feedback and being open-minded.*

**It’s about taking feedback, learning from experience, and coming up with strategies for improving.** 
like a wise man once said:
> It’s believing that even if you fail at something, you can still succeed.
